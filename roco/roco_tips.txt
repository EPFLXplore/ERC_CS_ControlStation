-----To add a new packet-----

1) Write the packet in the protocol file  (e.g. Protocol21W3.h), i.e. create
a structure and fill it with the needed variables.
Example:

struct DataPacket {
	uint32_t data;
} __attribute__((packed));

Don't forget to add the suffix "__attribute__((packed))".

2) Define the packet in the class initialization in the NetworkBus.cpp file
and don't forget to add its id (must be different than the ids of the other
packets and smaller than 64).
Example:

define<DataPacket>(32);

3) Register the packet by adding it to the file ProtocolRegisters.h in the
correctly defined protocol (between #ifdef PROTOCOL_21W3 and #endif).
Example:

REGISTER(DataPacket)

4) All done ! Enjoy using your newly designed packet.
